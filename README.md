# Object separator
I've done this as part of an OpenCV online course.
### Introduction
The Object Separator project is a sophisticated software tool developed as a capstone project for an OpenCV online course offered by CSVISAO Computacional. This project demonstrates the practical application of computer vision techniques using the OpenCV library to detect, identify, and segregate objects within digital images.

### Project Overview
The core functionality of the Object Separator is to process images, identify distinct objects within those images, and then relocate the identified objects into a separate directory for further analysis or use. This process involves complex image processing and computer vision techniques, making extensive use of the OpenCV library to achieve accurate object detection and manipulation.

### Key Features
Object Detection: Utilizes OpenCV's powerful image processing capabilities to detect and identify objects within a given image.
Automatic Segregation: Automatically segregates the detected objects, storing them in a dedicated directory named "objects" for easy access and further processing.
User-friendly: Designed with ease of use in mind, requiring minimal setup and interaction from the user to process images.
Customization Options: Offers options for customization, allowing users to tailor the object detection parameters according to their specific needs.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Object Separator project, please ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Python: A recent version of Python, preferably Python 3.6 or later.
OpenCV Library: Ensure the OpenCV Python library is installed. You can install it via pip with the command pip install opencv-python.

### Customizing Object Detection
The Object Separator allows for customization of object detection parameters to suit various image types and object characteristics. To adjust these parameters, edit the configuration settings within the object_separator.py script. Documentation within the script provides guidance on how these parameters influence object detection and segregation.

# Conclusion
The Object Separator project showcases the practical application of computer vision and image processing techniques to identify and segregate objects within images. It serves as an exemplary project for those looking to explore the capabilities of the OpenCV library in a real-world application. Whether for educational purposes, research, or practical application, this project offers a robust foundation for further exploration into the field of computer vision.
